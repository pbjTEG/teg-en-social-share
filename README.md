# TEG Engaging Networks Social Share
Add Bluesky, Mastodon, or Threads buttons to Engaging Network's social share buttons. As a demonstration, there's a live static page with Bluesky, Mastodon, and Threads buttons on TEG's EN Sandbox site:

https://ca-sandbox.engagingnetworks.io/page/154412/action/1

## Content

[Add_Bluesky.html](src/Add_Bluesky.html)  
[Add_Mastodon.html](src/Add_Mastodon.html)  
[Add_Threads.html](src/Add_Threads.html)

## Dependancies

None. Even the included images are embedded in the code as SVGs.

## Installation

1. Begin with EN's instructions for their standard social sharing: 

   https://knowledge.engagingnetworks.net/pagebuilder/social-networking-tools

   The custom code requires at least one of EN's standard buttons visible on the page.

2. Copy the content of the selected addition into a text block at the bottom of the page on which you have configured the standard EN social share buttons. 

The customization will pick up title and canonical URL from the meta data tags generated by EN. Image style will be matched to the first visible standard social sharing link.

### Optional

In order to use the "custom" image setting in EN, there is an `<img>` tag which allows linking to a custom image. The `id` attribute of the image must be `customMastodon`.

For example:

```<img src="https://joinmastodon.org/logos/logo-purple.svg" id="customMastodon" alt="Free, open-source decentralized social media.">```

## Bluesky

The link will simply share the title and canonical URL. 

### Styles

The `<a>` element can be selected in CSS with `.en__socialShare.en__socialShare--bluesky` similar to the standard buttons. The base styles for `.en__socialShare` will apply. The `<img>` element can be selected with the same `.en__socialShare__image` selector and will pick up EN's base styles.

## Mastodon

The button will show a popup allowing the user to select (or specify) their Mastodon instance. Then, it will share the title an canonical URL just like the Bluesky link.

### Styles

The `<button>` element can be selected in CSS with `.en__socialShare.en__socialShare--mastodon` similar to the standard buttons. The base styles for `.en__socialShare` will apply. The `<img>` element can be selected with the same `.en__socialShare__image` selector and will pick up EN's base styles.

The popup has the following DOM structure which will be appended to the `<body>` element:

```
div#mstdnInstSelBack
   fieldset#mstdnInstSel
      legend[for="mstdnInstSel"]
      select#mstdnInsts
      input#"mstdnInstOther[type="button"]
```
